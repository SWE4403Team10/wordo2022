### Project Overview

#### ðŸ’¡ Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design reusable and
extendable software by implementing design patterns, following good coding practices,
and working in teams.   
   

#### ðŸ’» Project Description
For this project, we will be creating a single player client-based application in Java called
Wordo. The objective of this game will be to guess a mystery word in a certain number of
tries while receiving feedback after each guess in the form of coloured tiles indicating when
letters occupy the correct position. Players will be able to choose how many letters the word
is and customize the difficulty based on how many guesses they would like to have to get the
word. After the player chooses the word length and number of guesses, the game will start.

To create this game, we have ideas to implement design patterns such as the iterator pattern,
visitor method, command pattern, and builder pattern. More details surrounding the
implementation of patterns will be provided once we have approval on the direction of the
project.
